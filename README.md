Submitted by: Adriel Dube

**Trivia Game App** is an app that allows users to answer trivia questions across various categories. The app fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API, allowing users to test their knowledge. Players can track their scores and reset the game for a new set of questions.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Notes

During the development of this app, I encountered the following challenges:

- **Handling the API data**: The trivia questions returned from the Open Trivia Database API sometimes contained HTML encoded characters, such as `&quot;` for quotes. 
- **Managing button states**: The button text font was reverting back to the default settings after setting the question

Regardless, it was a fun app to work on and implement
